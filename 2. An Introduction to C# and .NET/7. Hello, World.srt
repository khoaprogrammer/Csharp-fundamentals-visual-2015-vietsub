1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Inside of Windows I'm going to go to the Start menu, and I'm going to do a search just by typing for command

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
because what I want to open up is the command prompt. We're going to write our first program using some

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
low-level tools and without Visual Studio just so you can see a little bit about what is happening behind the scenes.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
When you install Visual Studio, Visual Studio will install some command line tools that you can use to create applications.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Not many people will use the command line tools on a day-to-day basis, they'll use Visual Studio instead,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but what I'm just trying to do right now is simplify some things.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So I'm going to go into my Documents folder, and I'm just going to use notepad to create a file called hello.cs.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The goal is to create the canonical hello world example, something I can run and just print the string hello

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
world to the screen, and I'll do that by placing my code inside a file called hello.cs.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Dot cs is the common extension for C# source code. All of the .NET tools and every .NET developer will know

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that a .cs file will contain C# source code. And inside of here I'm going to create a class.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So there are many concepts that we're going to have to come to grips with in this very simple demo,

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
things like classes and strange keywords, and we will cover all of these things in detail throughout this course.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
For right now, just know that most of the code that you write for .NET will live inside of a class.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And inside of a class I can create methods. I'm going to create a method called Main.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The start of this method begins with this opening curly brace and ends with this closing curly brace.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Just like with the class, anything I put between those outer curly braces will be part of this class or

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
inside of this class, and now anything I put inside of this Main method will be code that executes when I

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
run this program. And that's because there's a little bit of magic happening here.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
When the CLR starts a command line application, what we call a console application, something that I would

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
run from the command prompt, it will automatically look for a program class with a Main method and just start

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
executing the code inside of there for me. So if I were to place inside of here something like

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
System.Console.WriteLine, Hello World, then this is something very similar to the code that we had on the slide.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We had Console.WriteLine. What's new here is this System word, and this System word exists because inside

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
of .NET there are thousands and thousands of classes that I can use, classes like Console.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And we don't want all 10,000 or more classes available at one time, so what .NET does is it partitions

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
classes into various namespaces. And to use a class, you have to be very explicit and let .NET know from

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
what namespace that class lives in. So to use the Console class, it lives in the namespace called System,

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
so I either have to use the word System here or there's another way to tell .NET about the namespaces that I

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
need, and that is with the using keyword. So if I say using System and a semicolon, and yes there are

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
certain pieces of code that have to end with a semicolon and certain pieces of code that don't need a

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
semicolon, we'll talk about that more throughout the course, when I say using System, I'm telling .NET and

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
this tool we're about to see, known as the C# compiler, that when it encounters classes inside of this

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
program, classes like Console, it should look for them inside of the System namespace.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And this is about the simplest possible C# program that I could write.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to save this file and come out to the command line and run a tool called csc.exe.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This tool exists, by default, in my Windows directory under a folder called Microsoft.NET.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Inside of there, there will be a Framework folder, and then inside of a Framework folder you can have various

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
installations of the .NET Framework, multiple versions. And if I tab through here, you can see I have

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
various versions installed, version 1, version 1.1, version 2. I want to go to the latest version,

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
which is the version 4 directory because inside of there, there will be a little program that I can run called csc.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Csc, as you can see, is the Visual C# Compiler, so C# code is code that needs to be compiled before it can execute.

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is unlike some other languages, languages like Perl, and Ruby, and Python.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What I need to do with the C# code is pass it through the C# compiler, and what the C# compiler will do is

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
produce an executable that I can run. So if I say csc, and then follow that with the parameter hello.cs,

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm asking the C# compiler to compile hello.cs. And if the compiler encounters any problems, it will complain,

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but it looks like it finished successfully. And inside of this folder now I can see hello.exe, so the act of

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
compiling hello.cs produced hello.exe, and the exe extension means this is a executable file,

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
something that I can run from the command line. And if I run it just by typing in hello.exe, I get Hello, World!

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Now as I said before, typically you don't use csc directly. Instead, you use Visual Studio, and Visual Studio

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
will figure out the way to call csc correctly. But I do just want to point out that csc might give you some error messages.

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So, for example, let's say that I forget the semicolon after using system, and I recompile the application.

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The C# compiler here is very explicit, and it says semicolon was expected on line 1, column 13.

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Unfortunately, not all error messages are so explicit. Let's come down and leave off an opening curly brace

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
here on my method because now the C# compiler won't know where this method starts.

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And if I save that file and try to compile it again, this one missing character actually generated three

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
different error messages, is telling me a semicolon was expected, and there's an invalid token.

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And over time you'll become accustomed to these error messages and become accustomed to looking at your C#

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
code and figuring out things like, oh I just had a missing curly brace here.

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And if I save this file again, we should be back in working order, but let's make one more change.

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Instead of displaying the text Hello, World, let's use some more code from that previous slide, and I want

62
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
to print out the current day of the week. And I can do that by using the DateTime class.

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That DateTime class is also in the system namespace, so it is available to me.

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I can have multiple using statements here, but the only classes I'm using for this simple example are classes

65
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
that are in the System namespace. I'm going to say please print out DataTime.Now.DayOfWeek.

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And I'll save hello.cs again. I need to recompile it for csc to pick up those changes and produce a new

67
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
executable, but now I should be able to run hello.exe. And you can see that this example is being recorded

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
on a Wednesday. So this simple example has a lot of very deep concepts, concepts like classes and strange

69
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
keywords like static and void. I want you to ignore some of those specific syntax details for right now.

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We'll get to the point where you can understand all of those. For right now, I just want to take a step back

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and talk about this compiler that we're using, and after that we can jump into Visual Studio

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and get the same code running from Visual Studio.
